Mercury spends about three weeks in a sign if it is direct; when retrograde it spends eight to ten weeks. To learn more about Mercury retrograde, follow this Link. Since the planet is always within 28Â° of the Sun's zodiacal position, it occupies the same zodiac sign as the Sun, the preceding sign or the following sign, never further away than that.

									"Mercury is considered androgynous, assuming the gender of the sign it occupies. In the Western world it rules logical-linear reasoning, the collection and organization of information, communication and transportation equipment, travel, touch, speaking and writing. The archetype of Mercury is also found in other cultures, assuming a most interesting spectrum of duties. He/she is the Egyptian-Greek Hermes Trismegestus, guardian of esoteric doctrine; the Egyptian counterpart is Thoth, author of the Emerald Tablets, master builder and guardian of higher wisdom. To the Norse he is Loki the trickster, loyal to no one and player of both ends against the middle. To some Native Americans he is Coyote, also a trickster, who plays the best tricks on himself. In all instances, Mercury can do one thing no other gods or men can do, namely travel as messenger between the upper, physical and underworlds of existence without harm.",

I remember a time not long ago, when no one spoke about what that thing meant, aside from being a symbol of the medical profession and ambulance drivers. Maybe it had something to do with healing, but what would two snakes, which are often labeled as evil in Western religious dogma, have to do with doctors? Slowly I was able to squeeze out that the caduceus referred principally to Kundalini energy in motion.",

									"What is 'Kundalini'? It is an Indian term for bio-electricity, a fluid magnetic energy that can rise up the spine when consciousness is simulated and doors to the subconscious are opened. It is linked to the Sanskrit word 'Chaitanya' or integration of psychological, mental, emotional and spiritual parts of the self. If one's circuits are working properly, e.g. an open circuit of Kundalini energy flow, there is no more mind-body split. Clairvoyant and clairaudient abilities are activated and one feels connected with the rest of the universe. If this energy is accessed positively and not directed merely into enhanced sexual gratification, the ego can be put in its place as a tool instead of presumed to be the center of identity. One can then build authentic self within unconditional love, dynamic harmony between yin and yang aspects of being; there is connection with spirit and cosmic mind instead, as an experience of reality.",

If accessed negatively, bioelectric energy can be directed via ritual and concentration of will towards nefarious ends such as controlling other people. Also, activated Kundalini energy can awaken atavistic skill in perceiving and directing disincarnate entities in elemental and astral dimensions. Obviously, given the average human preoccupation with power, such an ability could easily be used towards destructive ends.",

									"But there are two snakes in the caduceus, not one. This would refer to twin ascending and descending currents of energy manifestation, known also as coagulating and dissolving forces in western esoteric thought. The second snake refers to an active process of giving and receiving input from higher mind, maybe even Cosmic Mind. This would be very difficult to allow in practice if one needs to believe themselves a separate entity and that the conscious mind is our own construct. Modern psychology suggests that very little of our real will or intelligence is used, if at all in everyday life. Instead, a number of automatic programs can run the show; distorted and short-circuited commands and processes created whole cloth from childhood trauma, conditioned religious and social behaviors, family inheritance and psychic energy cells emanating from collective sources (yes, people are trained from birth to believe in status, unending judgmental guilt and sexual shame). Why not throw in certain unquestioned psychosomatic-somatic constructs run amok, namely fear (of death), greed, victimization, and faith in rigid status quo hierarchies that do not have your best interests at heart?",

Even today, do conditioned, civilized individuals ever really feel Kundalini energy and submit to penetration by Cosmic Mind, or do the hipsters amongst us lie a lot? How much can we participate in it if our capacity for sexual response labors under a fear of surrender, a compulsive need for control and to remain disassociated (separate) from unity with other energy fields? How long could an activated Kundalini state of being survive in the conventional workplace, honoring exploitive practices and 'team spirit'? How enlightened can folks who prefer to live in their mind and view their bodies as 'a mere vessel of clay' be? To spread it around a little to the rest of the world, how would the Kundalini concept play in societies where woman is largely a conception device without a reasoning mind or permission to experience sexual pleasure?",

									"Concerned others postulate that if we gave up 'civilized' moral dictates, and seriously gave ourselves over to cultivating this ditsy bio-spiritual interaction we would run wild, degenerate quickly into anarchy and destroy civilization. Based on my own ditsy observations, it doesn't happen. When one no longer functions out of denial or repression, one is aware of the entire scope of one's program, shadow aspects and all. If, at the same time, the switch connecting spirit, soul, mind and nature is also thrown to 'open', no deviant behavior occurs because one is no longer separate from or superior to, anything. One interfaces with the entire enchilada of the self, earthly warts and divine vitalizing force all-in-one, and thus is placed in intimate contact with the rest of creation's web.",

Of course, a lot of us don't care to go there as it would interfere with TV time. Are there some people who simply are not constructed to let two-way activation of Kundalini energy occur?

I do not see anything running rampant at the expense of anything else unless it is under stress and given no habitat within which to comfortably cohabit. No sexual perversion, frigidity, pedophilia, nymphomania or obsession with porn that I can spy out in them woods either.

Maybe we have this thing turned around; nature is a living template of what existence in balance means; it is our particular definitions of 'civilization' that lie willfully outside the divine plan. Those of us who grow weary of the chase, can activate the second snake of the caduceus, giving up to Cosmic Mind the trash, old habits, outdated behaviors, burning compulsions, sins (sin = not being true to yourself) that can fester unchecked into disease.
