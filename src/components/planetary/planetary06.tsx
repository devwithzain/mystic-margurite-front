It has a thin atmosphere, the terrain is variable with mountain ranges, canyons, vast flood plains and ancient impact craters.

Mars energy at the stations can feel more heated, intense, inclined to inciting fights and projecting a willful moodiness.

In turning retro most commonly the libido is re-directed; this could mean gradually turning celibate, changing sexual preferences or leaving a committed relationship for some sort of experimental situation. In turning direct there are dramatic changes in the outward deployment of one’s assertive and active drives, which takes about three years to gather momentum and “get the hang of it” in working with more free-wheeling forms of activity. With either station there is a quite dramatic re-orientation and/or change in direction of one’s activities and goals in life.",
