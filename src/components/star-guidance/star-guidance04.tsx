As relates to synestry, when one person's planets are right next to another's nodes, the bond is sure to be complex and magnetizing in nature. So even if the contacts are difficult, as when involving Saturn (limitations, loss, burdens, ego) or Mars (violence), chances are the two involved will compulsively be drawn back again and again to re-inact certain unfinished business.",

Someone's Mars (aggression, anger, the drive to dominate) landing on another's Decendant angle or seventh house of partners and open enemies is usually not an indicator for friendly, supportive behavior, whereas Venus placed there can increase the desire to over-indulge, but could also enhance the potential for financial gains through the partner.",

In partnership, two people with a majority of planets occupying either side of a see-saw or in square through synestry would commonly be seeking to complete or heal a missing part of themselves through relationship with the other. This dynamic often plays out as intense, compulsive attraction in the beginning, followed by war and then repulsion in the longer haul, unless the shadow side of what has been rejected by self is held up to the light and integrated.

If both individuals have hard Mercury-Neptune contacts, we can hope that both entertain the same ethics and hold the same illusions in common, not so bad.

Mercury in hard aspect to Saturn or Mars in an individual's chart can make for criticism, perfectionism or unpleasant loss of temper; in synestry with another's planets any of this combo can set off fireworks, humiliate or inspire into action.
