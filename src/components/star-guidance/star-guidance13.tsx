The period of time over which the Moon goes through a cycle in its visibility corresponds approximately to 28 days. The ancient calendars of many cultures were based on this cycle, assigning thirteen lunar months plus a few days of correction to the year; the calendar of twelve months based on the apparent movement of the Sun around Earth was developed later on. Cultures based on the lunar calendar also engaged in some form of Mater Matrona or Great Mother worship, which featured the concept of Trinity in symbolic form.",

Unfortunately, down through the times of patriarchal culture the number thirteen and much of the sacred symbolism attached to it became an unlucky omen, just as much that was held sacred in Great Mother worship was either demonized or adapted into later religious practice under a different name and function.",

By the ancient arcane phrase 'As it is above, so it is below,' the lighted Moon can be compared with the light of consciousness as it shines on a tiny portion of the vastness that contains both the individual unconscious and higher self, the human collective and the web of life that is Gaia. There is some argument in astrology over what the Moon represents; perhaps the Moon symbolizes the ebb and flow of our conscious and unconscious as these faculties intermingle with the web of manifestation within which each physical form is embedded. The Moon also reflects the emotional body along with its attendant powers of intuition and instinct. In the more difficult range of meaning it also can represent the ancestral past; those patterns of thought, emotion and behavior which we have inherited and use as the basis for our sense of self, until we begin to wake up to the greater territory of holistic self as it unites with the Web of Life.",

Until recently, many priests and astrologers have likened the Sun to the Father and the Divine Son, both spiritually and literally.

Others of us are more attuned to putting personal desire first, such as an aggressive businessmen who is sure God favors the financially astute.

By the time of the first quarter another crisis looms; themes and definitions of self are crystallizing, but how does this structure fit with the larger world?

For someone born around the Full Moon phase it is important to release one's themes and creations out into the world. We can experience quite a crisis around getting head and heart, intellect and instinct onto the same page; the state of being can be quite dualistic, split between 'in here' and 'out there' is common.

Service and sacrifice may be the most evolved way to live with an 'old' Moon, but there are some born into this phase who may have refined the art of being self-involved to a high degree instead. Old Moon folks are frequently very capable at finding sustenance in the world but they are essentially removed from the mundane lifestyle in some way.

								needs? What sort of person was your mother and how did she
								interact with you? What does the elemental signature and aspects
								made by the Moon say about instinct, intuition, and access to
								the dreamtime and astral realms? What is the nature of the
								emotional body, how are feelings and emotions processed?
								Examples: Moon in Aquarius in the sixth house of unresolved
								issues, health, co-workers, service and small animals. Aquarian
								Moon can use distance and detachment as a security need; in the
								sixth house it can represent one who is shy and alienated from
								others; expressed positively it can point to someone who serves
								in the alternative healing industry. Libra Moon in the second
								house of values, self-esteem and making money; Moon in Libra
								loves to socialize and usually does not favor the rude or crude
								in demeanor; in the second house it can indicate someone who's
								self-esteem is tied to their popularity or who makes their money

								Aspects made by the Moon to other planets and points in the

								Venus (values, self-esteem, the feminine sexual)can indicate
								conflicts within self identity as a nurturer and "mother" versus
								being a sexual, independent woman; Madonna-whore complex in a
								man. Moon square Mars (aggression,drive,libido)has issues with
								channeling emotions and desires; this energy can express as
								destructive, impulsive anger or focused and determined ambition.
								Moon square Jupiter (expansion, fortune, belief systems,)can be
								boisterous, gregarious and generous or prone to exaggeration and
								over-the-top behavior, even crisis-prone in the direction of
								nervous breakdown or eating disorders.

								The Moon's Nodes are powerful tools with which to explore both

								Head () pertains to the path of soul growth. The position of
								this Node and aspects made to it can be most useful for

								Astrologers use a technique called Secondary Progressions to
								learn more about the current emotional tone and focus of
								interest likely for an individual. These progressions are found
								by advancing the positions of the planets about one day for each
								year of life. The progressed Moon is most immediately useful as
								it moves a little over a degree per month, depending on when
								during the year a person is born. The progressed Moon shows
								where we are currently in mental process, what the most
								immediate focus in life is likely to be at any given time;
								progressed Moon can serve as a trigger by aspect for the
								manifestation of major events in life, as we are co-creators in
								determining the course of our experience on the earthly plane.
