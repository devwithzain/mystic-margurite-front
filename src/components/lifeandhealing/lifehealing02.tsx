From work and fitness to personal well-being and self-care, many tools for transformation initially relied on online platforms. Now there are many more people who prefer the convenience of non-local treatments, being able to connect to offerings and practitioners all over the world. Therapy and coaching online is nothing new. However, when it comes to vibrational or energetic medicine there is still some skepticism about how much it can do through a screen.",

									"The most important thing to say at the beginning is that we are working with the quantum field - the invisible field of consciousness which connects everything that exists. When it comes to the discussion of matter versus energy, a common misconception is the belief that only matter emits a field of energy. In fact it works both ways. The field is the primary agent that affects the molecule. In other words the field affects matter - a tree, an organ, a stone, basically everything that has life force. Energy medicine works with life force. We don't look at changing the molecular structure, but we change the field which influences the form and this has an impact on the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual body of an individual.",

									"The principle of entanglement works across the field despite the distance. So you don’t need to be in the presence of a person to work with them. You just need a name, thought or any other form of connection to be connected in the quantum field. We in Life Alignment have been doing non local transmission for many years and countless testimonials show that the work is equally effective as if the client and healer were in the same room. It's pretty easy to understand why. When we are on Zoom or Skype we have a visual connection to our client which allows us to attune with their particular frequency. In addition we work with the name and birthdate or a physical witness such as a hair sample or handwriting which represents the radio frequency of the individual and connects to their DNA pattern. Practitioners and clients create a unified field of energy beyond the distance.",

									"The whole universe is a field of consciousness. Imagine it like this: The air around us is in random chaos; it's just vibrating randomly according to whatever influences it. The moment we put a particular focus or intention on something the molecules become organized. This is also how the principle of Vortex technology works. Every magnetic Vortex card has its own wavelength which means the field is organized with a particular purpose. Also each body point has a unique wavelength because it has a different frequency. Each thought, each feeling… all is organized by the frequency and wavelength of the related energy. In other words, independently if we work online or offline we put out the intention to free a blockage in the field of consciousness. Where there is blockage there is low frequency. By raising the frequency we help to release that blockage and restore the field back to its healthy, natural state. That will have an impact on different aspects of our body, life and the planet.",

This network is part of the field and works beyond the mind and knows exactly what particular frequency is needed to be established for the clients best benefit. This differentiates Life Alignment from other mental based concepts. We attune to the higher intention which is embedded in the process of the Life Alignment System.",

However at a soul level, which is beyond their awareness, they may have a desire for transformation.

									"For example, I worked with a mother some time ago. She had a very difficult relationship with her son. He was swearing at her, ignoring her and all efforts from her side have been responded with “Don't try to change me!”. She reached out to me asking if I could do a balance on her son. He wasn't open to this but his soul gave permission and I used her as a surrogate. During the session we restored an energetic wall between the two. The crucial element of this was that the mother let go of control and de-creates this wall of protection which was no longer needed. So the session ended up working on the root cause of the mother and her choice of letting go of her son and the effect was it opened up something in the quantum field between her and the son. When the mother came home, her son opened the door and was completely different to her from there on.",
