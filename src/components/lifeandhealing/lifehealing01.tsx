Body, mind, heart and soul are tempered through trauma, family patterning, social and religious mandates and challenging encounters with others.  Limiting beliefs, creative blocks and self-sabotaging programs are crafted over time through these interfaces.  The inner judge, rescuer and victim within us can thus compromise healthy self-love and self-expression, distort the inner spiritual ground.  When we cannot honor ourselves as a sacred temple, illness can result.",

Because this process is led via the client’s Higher Consciousness, resolution is rapid and deep; clients choose how often they want a treatment (or ‘balance’ as it is called)-thus making it an extremely effective modality.”",

If one abides in victim mode, the universe cannot be supportive, there for does not come in to heal.  It is not the job of the practitioner to remove self-created barriers that provide a sense of safety or feed an addiction even if detrimental to well-being.    When a client is dedicated to “I choose to” or “I am” and taking responsibility, old toxic structures will release, and new potentials can come in.
