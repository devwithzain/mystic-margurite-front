It is a very accurate system that clearly identifies where stress is stored and is blocking your energy flow.

As energy is the reality of all that  really exists, physical appearance for treatment is not necessary.

Vortex technology consists of a series of Vortex Cards, which are small magnetic discs encased in laminated cards, each infused with high-energy frequencies that work with the inner environment(body-mind) and outer environment (buildings, food, water, plants etc.).  These are most commonly used to catalyze change, take down self-imposed barriers and blockages or support energetic flow between the subtle bodies and physical components of the body.",
