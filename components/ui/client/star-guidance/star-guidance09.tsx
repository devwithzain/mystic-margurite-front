Still others are so at home in their South Node sphere of activity (what was good enough for my folks is good enough for me) that the growth potential represented by the North Node is feared and repressed; the inclination is to live in the past, clinging to the same old, comfortable habits.",

Sometimes one hasn't a clue, can't retreat into what is familiar but must move forward into the unknown and unmastered. Sometimes one simply continues working with projects begun before.

									"The modern, evolutionary school of Nodal interpretation as originally presented by astrologer Jeff Greene, 1 and 2 promotes an acceptance of reincarnation as a means of understanding both tradition-bound habits and new exploratory trends that can find expression in an individual. Creating a story framed around past life themes can serve as a metaphorical basis for understanding what sort of lifestyles, traumas or past survival challenges could have contributed to certain repetitious and debilitating limitations we may face in the current life. One can then more easily develop a core of detached self-awareness from which to tolerate overwhelming feelings or take in uncomfortable information. Most importantly, one can find compassion for self and others who were involved in the personal comedy or tragedy of life. The story line can be used to arrange the data in such a way that the reasoning mind can work with emotionally-loaded triggers and mental hardwiring, get past the barrier of denial. Granting space for one's own clumsiness becomes easier; one can learn to move in spite of and with the fear that always comes with breaking into new territory.",

									"If not comfortable with the concept of reincarnation, consider the possibility of traumas and ingrained beliefs formed in early childhood and/or inherited from family ancestors down through several generations, which are stored in the body at mental, instinctive and cellular levels of being and even more troublesome stored in the subtle body energy fields surrounding the body. These patterns continue to be triggered reactively at the unconscious or subconscious level in response to various emotional or environmental cues, whether they are good for us or not. This mechanism is the foundation for the defensive ego and its preference for running on autopilot, even while we declare ourselves to be 'doing what I want'.",

									"Sometimes the inheritance involves a psychic sensitivity which, unless managed consciously will tend to soak up the collective pain and anger out there like a sponge; we may be trying to heal issues that actually belong to someone else, something that also commonly occurs between parents and children. It is also so much easier to pay attention to someone else's problems rather than take on your own. All such negative habits persist so, mainly because they represent familiar territory with known limitations. Next time a sudden bout of anger arises for no reason, stop to notice if the sensation really belongs to you, or not. As a species we often seem to prefer a known hell to the risk of stepping out past the fences.",

									"Developing a sense for themes continuing over a span of several lifetimes can help us make sense of the lessons our soul chooses to pursue and get a grip on what it wants to actualize in the real world. Placing oneself on spiral path through time can show us where we need to balance desires with the limitations present in this life. We are given a handy tool of metaphor with which to disable excuses and design learning experiences that will further our goal for the future. Whichever way we choose to handle the proposition of past life knowledge, healing and cultivating deep personal insight starts with first with complete (not edited) self understanding, than giving ourselves permission to be disloyal to past conditioning and a one size fits all social mandate.

									"If one has experienced patterns of negative experience that happen over and over, this is a clear signal that there is an autopilot in the first place. We can learn to quiet the mind, pay close attention to what is really happening both outside and within, without benefit of egoic filters or blinders. In the beginning this can be very hard to do, first because the modern world offers so many ways to distract you from your self and from what is really happening. After that, one will be faced with numbness or with uncomfortable feelings and frustrated dreams never fully processed that flood forth from the memory banks. Much pain and rage can be stored in the cells of the body; when true communion of mind, body, soul and spirit is sought, often the first experience can be months of illness and peculiar bodily mis-alignments, as toxins release out into the blood stream for elimination. When fully awake, the whole repertoire of beloved survival myth created during childhood and any self-destructive, self disempowering habituation comes up for constant respooling and review; uncomfortable sensations that the ego creates to justify one's continued participation in the romper-room of the mind can arise to stop the process.",

									"One may even find that natural, healthy instincts as felt through body sensation have been sabotaged by mind. Suppose the body tells you that a certain silver-tongued devil over there across the room at the party clearly is wrong for you; but the mind concludes that since the body feels bad that person must be your passionate destiny-because a religious, school or parent-based instruction from childhood said all body sensations are of 'lower animal function', therefore not to be trusted. The subconscious notes: Instinct=primal=of nature=animal=stupid, evil or even treacherous. Actually, animals do not display any of these qualities, unless they have been brutalized by humans. Strange how domesticated humans can and do program their sex drives towards some variation on the theme of dominance or submission, love as pain or simply doing without.",

He may have to stand the test of choosing loneliness for awhile over giving body, time, energy and money away.
